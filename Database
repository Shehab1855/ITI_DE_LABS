When discussing your Database course at ITI, you can highlight the key topics youâ€™ve covered and explain their significance in database management and application development. Here's an outline for your speech:

---

### **Introduction**
- **Introduction to the Course**:  
  "In my Database course at ITI, I have gained in-depth knowledge of database concepts, design, and management. The course covered advanced topics essential for developing efficient and robust database solutions."

---

### **Key Topics**
1. **SELECT Statement**:  
   - "The SELECT statement is the cornerstone of SQL, allowing us to retrieve data from one or more tables. We explored how to use SELECT with filters, aggregations, and sorting to extract meaningful insights from datasets."

2. **JOINs**:  
   - "JOINs enable combining data from multiple tables based on a related column. I learned how to use different types of JOINs, such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN, to integrate data effectively and answer complex queries."

3. **Triggers**:  
   - "Triggers are automated responses to specific database events, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE. I worked on creating triggers to enforce business rules and maintain data integrity seamlessly."

4. **Functions**:  
   - "Functions in SQL help encapsulate reusable logic for calculations or data transformations. I created scalar and table-valued functions to simplify repetitive tasks and improve code maintainability."

5. **Stored Procedures**:  
   - "Stored procedures are precompiled SQL statements that can be executed with parameters. They enhance performance and security by centralizing logic on the server side. I designed and implemented stored procedures to automate complex processes."

6. **Indexes**:  
   - "Indexes improve query performance by allowing faster data retrieval. I studied clustered and non-clustered indexes and learned how to balance their use to optimize performance without compromising storage."

7. **Mapping**:  
   - "Mapping involves defining relationships between database tables, especially in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tools. I practiced mapping techniques to ensure proper data modeling and integration with applications."

---

### **Applications**
- "Through this course, I developed hands-on projects, applying these concepts to real-world scenarios. For example, I worked on building and optimizing databases for inventory management, e-commerce platforms, and reporting systems."

---

### **Conclusion**
- "This course has equipped me with the skills to design, implement, and manage databases efficiently. It has strengthened my understanding of database architecture and advanced features, preparing me to handle complex data challenges in my career."
