# Movie Data Scraper and CSV Exporter

This project involves scraping the top 200 highest-grossing movies from a website and saving the extracted data into a CSV file. The data includes the movie's rank, title, lifetime gross, and release year.

## Task Overview

The primary goal of this project is to extract movie data from a webpage, structure the data, and save it in a CSV format for further analysis. This is achieved using web scraping techniques with Python and the `Selenium` library for navigating the webpage.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Uses `Selenium` to scrape movie data from the website.
- **Data Parsing**: Extracts and organizes movie information into structured dictionaries.
- **CSV Export**: Saves the extracted movie data into a CSV file using Python's `csv` module.
- **File Format**: The data is saved in CSV format with the following fields:
  - `rank`: The rank of the movie.
  - `title`: The title of the movie.
  - `lifetime_gross`: The lifetime gross revenue of the movie.
  - `release_year`: The year the movie was released.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following Python packages:

- `selenium`: For web scraping.
- `csv`: For writing data to CSV (this is part of Python's standard library).

To install `selenium`, run:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

Additionally, you need to have a web driver (such as ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver) installed for `Selenium` to interact with your browser.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**: 
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Install the necessary dependencies using `pip`.
   - Run the script to start scraping the movie data.

2. **CSV Output**: 
   - The script will generate a CSV file named `movies.csv` containing the scraped movie data.

## Example Output

The `movies.csv` file will contain data in the following format:

```csv
rank,title,lifetime_gross,release_year
1,Avatar,$2,923,706,026,2009
2,Avengers: Endgame,$2,799,439,100,2019
3,Avatar: The Way of Water,$2,320,250,281,2022
...
```

## Notes

- The script assumes the website's structure remains consistent. If the website layout changes, the scraping logic might need to be adjusted.
- Make sure to respect the website's terms of service and robots.txt file when scraping.
